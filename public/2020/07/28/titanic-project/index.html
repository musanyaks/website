<p><strong>From above table there were more people in the third class compared to other classes while second class being least.</strong>
<strong>Next I’ll use a histogram to show if <code>Fare</code> is normaally distributed and also see its skewness.</strong></p>

<p><strong>From the table above it is evident that <code>Fare</code> is right skewed hence the price is not normal distributed.</strong>
<strong>Next is to draw a boxplot to see how price is distributed and also capture the outliers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>From the table above it is evident that more people from <code>Southampton</code> boarded the titanic and also it is them that died in large number than the rest and also it is them that died most while least death and survival registered by <code>Queenstown</code>.</strong>
